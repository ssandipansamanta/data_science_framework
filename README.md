### Creating Data Science Framework

This framework would be helpful to know different packages available in different languages. 
Currently I am trying to cover same analysis using the following languages and prepare a comparison study between them.

* R
* python
* Julia
* java
* scala

The directory set up is as follows:
```
data_science_framework:

|-- Inputs: Keep input files
|-- Outputs: Outputs will be saved in this folder.
|-- src
       |-- R: R-codes
       |-- python: python-codes
       |-- julia: Julia-codes
       |-- Java: Java-codes
       |-- scala: scala-codes
       
       
```
